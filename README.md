# Spam-Mail-Prediction
In this project, I have applied algorithms to classify mails as "Spam" or "Ham"("Real") and chose the algorithm which results better on the Test and Train set.

Things to learn in this project:-/
1) Label Encoding/
2) Data Splitting /
3) Feature Extraction(Tf-Idf Vectorizer)/
4) Modelling/
